Computer Vision based Robotics Event organized by Robodarshan(Robotics Club of IIEST, Shibpur) in Automaton 2015 (techfest).
The repository contains:
1. Matlab files for image processing
2. Arduino files for bot movement

## Problem Statement:

Make a vision guided bot to move through some goal points avoiding some moving autonomous enemy bots(Guards).
Goal points: These are some GREEN objects that your bot needs to reach.
Guards: These are RED objects which moves in a straight line for some time, stops, rotates by a random angle and starts moving in this new direction.
Arena Boundary: Physical Limit that your bot won't be allowed to cross.
